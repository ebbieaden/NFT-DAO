//* How to change this file
/*
- Fill in the `ContractName` with your contract name.
- Uncomment the verification process if you want to verify your contract but make sure to uncomment the same in the `hardhat.config.js` and change the values as required.

You can pass in values into your contract like doing the following :
ex : Asssume you have a string and a number to pass
` const lock = await Lock.deploy("hello", 5);`
*/

//* Sample Deployment

  const Lock = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("ContractName");
  const lock = await Lock.deploy();

  await lock.deployed();

  console.log("Contract Deployed to : ", lock.address);
